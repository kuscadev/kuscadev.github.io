# ddc-gui

Lightweight system tray brightness controller for external monitors on Linux using DDC/CI.

Most Linux desktop environments lack a simple and reliable way to control external monitor brightness via DDC/CI.
This project aims to provide a minimal, fast, and native-feeling solution.

---

## ✨ Features

* Tray (AppIndicator) integration
* Quick brightness presets
* Precision control with popup slider
* Minimal and lightweight (GTK3 based)
* Works with `ddcutil`

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Linux (X11)
* `ddcutil`
* Python 3
* GTK 3 bindings (`python3-gi`)
* `libayatana-appindicator3`

### Install dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install ddcutil python3-gi gir1.2-gtk-3.0 gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1
```

---

## 🚀 Usage
Before running, verify your monitor is detected:

```bash
ddcutil detect
```

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## 🔄 Autostart

To start the application automatically on login, create a `.desktop` entry:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
nano ~/.config/autostart/ddc-gui.desktop
```

Paste the following:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=ddc-gui
Exec=python3 /full/path/to/main.py
Icon=display-brightness-symbolic
Terminal=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
```

> Replace `/full/path/to/main.py` with the actual path to your project.

---

### Alternative (Recommended)

If you install the app system-wide, you can simplify:

```ini
Exec=/usr/bin/python3 /full/path/to/main.py
```

---

### Notes

* Make sure the script is executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x main.py
  ```
* Some desktop environments may require logout/login after setup.
* Make sure your user has permission to access I2C devices (usually by being in the `i2c` group).

## ⚠️ Known Issues

* Bus ID is currently hardcoded
* Brightness is not synced on startup
* Limited multi-monitor support
* Error handling is minimal

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* [ ] Auto-detect monitor (DDC bus)
* [ ] Sync current brightness on startup
* [ ] Multi-monitor support
* [ ] Config file support
* [ ] Packaging (.deb)
* [ ] Improved error handling
