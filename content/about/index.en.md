# Hi, I’m Oğuzhan 👋

I’m not the product of a linear career plan.

My path spans from law school to Computer Programming, and from there to Management Information Systems—shaped by experimentation, questioning, and deliberate changes in direction.

Today, my focus is on understanding technical systems, simplifying them, and—where possible—making them more efficient. I don’t see this journey as something that ends, but rather as something that continues by deepening over time.

## ⏳ My Journey

- **2025 — Management Information Systems & Technical Writing**  
  After completing my Computer Programming education, I transitioned into Management Information Systems.  
  Focused on bridging software and business processes while writing technical articles on Linux, Python, and open-source projects. Writing became not a showcase, but a tool to discipline my thinking and learning.

- **2024 — Open Source, Linux, and Projects**  
  Developed small but practical projects such as **AutoFiler** and **QuickLinks**, addressing file management and fast access problems.  
  Explored Linux and open-source ecosystems with a focus on privacy and system ownership.

- **2022 — Transition into Software**  
  Started an associate degree in Computer Programming, focusing on technical education and hands-on projects.

- **2018 – 2022 — Academic Transition Period**  
  A period spent in a different academic field (Law) before deciding to pursue my career in a completely new direction. It was one of the turning points of my life.

- **High School Years**  
  Tried learning C++ in 10th grade, wrote `hello world`, then took a long break from programming. Looking back today, even that early attempt was an important starting point.

## 🛠 Toolset

Technologies I actively use and think about:

**Operating System & Environment**

- Debian Linux & Windows 10

**Development & Automation**

- Python
- Bash
- Git

**Web Fundamentals**

- HTML
- CSS

I’m less interested in tools themselves, and more in **how and why** they are used.

## 🎯 My Perspective

I build this site—and my work—around three core principles:

- **Independence**  

  An approach that doesn’t merely consume ready-made solutions, but builds custom tools when necessary.

- **Simplicity**  

  Turning complex technical concepts into clear, understandable, and maintainable solutions.

- **Sharing & Learning**  

  I believe knowledge deepens when it is shared.  

  Writing and building are not individual goals for me, but part of a process of mutual learning.
