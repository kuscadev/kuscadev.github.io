It scans your Downloads folder (or any target directory) and categorizes files into subfolders based on their extensions.\n\u0026ldquo;Turn chaos into order with a single command.\u0026rdquo;\nFeatures # Dynamic Path Detection: Automatically detects the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory and locates the Downloads folder on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Smart Categorization: Uses a dictionary-based mapping system to sort files into specific categories (Images, Documents, Archives, etc.). Safe Execution: Skips hidden files (dotfiles) and existing directories. Includes try-except blocks to handle permission errors or file conflicts gracefully. Checks if the target folder exists before attempting operations. Universal Compatibility: Uses os.path.join for cross-platform compatibility.

However, if you are a Linux enthusiast who prefers a distribution not based on Debian/Ubuntu (like Fedora, Arch, OpenSuse etc.), a slightly unpleasant surprise awaits you on Cisco\u0026rsquo;s download page: Only a .deb package is available. The absence of an official version in stores like Snap or Flatpak usually forces users into two inconvenient options: Setting up a Virtual Machine (VM) and straining system resources. Switching distributions just for this single application.\nHowever, there is a third and much more efficient way: Distrobox. In this guide, I will explain how to run Packet Tracer like a native application without chancing your Linux distribution or dealing with heavy virtual machines.\nWhat is Distrobox? # I won\u0026rsquo;t go into a lengthy explanation of the architecture here, but briefly: Distrobox is a tool that allows you to run any Linux distribution of your choice inside your current terminal using containerization tools like Docker or Podman. For more detailed information, you can visit the official Distrobox website. Installing Distrobox You can install Distrobox using your distribution\u0026rsquo;s package manager, just like any other software.\nOpenSUSE:\nsudo zypper install distrobox Solus:\nsudo eopkg install distrobox Fedora:\nsudo dnf install distrobox For other distributions, you can install it similarly using your package manager. Note: If Podman or Docker was not installed automatically during the Distrobox installation, you need to install one of them. I will proceed using Podman in this guide.\nInstalling Packet Tracer We have completed the Distrobox and Podman installations. Now , it\u0026rsquo;s time to create the environment where we can install .deb packages. Open your terminal and run the following commands in order: Create a Debian environment using Distrobox: (I used the $USER variable here so it works automatically for your username)\ndistrobox-create --name Debian --image debian:12 --home /home/$USER/distrobox/debian12 Enter the Debian environment: distrobox-enter Debian Update the environment: sudo apt update Install the necessary dependencies: sudo apt install libqt5multimedia5 libqt5xml5 libqt5script5 libqt5scripttools5 libqt5sql5 Now comes the easiest part. You need to go to Cisco\u0026rsquo;s website and download Packet Tracer. Make sure to select the Ubuntu version. Once the download is complete, return to the terminal (ensure you are still inside the Distrobox container)\ncd ~/Downloads # Or navigate to wherever you saved the file. Install the downloaded file: sudo apt install ./CiscoPacketTracer... # Tip: Type \u0026#39;sudo apt install ./Cisco\u0026#39; and hit Tab to auto-complete the filename. Accessing Packet Tracer from the Application Menu # Congratulations! Technically, the installation is complete. However, right now, you would need to enter the Debian container via the terminal to launch Packet Tracer. To avoid this and make it accessible like a regular app, there is one final step. Run this command in the terminal (inside the container):\ndistrobox-export -app packettracer That\u0026rsquo;s it! You can now access and run Cisco Packet Tracer directly from your system\u0026rsquo;s application menu. You can close the terminal now.\n","date":"21 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/blog/distrobox-packet-tracer-kurulumu/","section":"All Posts","summary":"","title":"How to Install Cisco Packet Tracer on Linux Using Distrobox","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"21 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/how-to/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"How-To","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"21 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/html/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Html","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"21 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/linux/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Linux","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"21 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/markdown/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Markdown","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"21 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/nas%C4%B1l-yap%C4%B1l%C4%B1r/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Nasıl Yapılır","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"21 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/sample/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sample","type":"tags"},{"content":" QuickLinks # QuickLinks is a simple browser start page that allows you to quickly access your frequently used websites. It is built using HTML and CSS. The project enables users to organize and customize their links.\nDemo # You can check out a live demo of QuickLinks here: QuickLinks Demo.\nFeatures # Quick Access: Access your frequently used websites with a single click. User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive design. Customizable: You can add and organize your own links. Technologies # HTML CSS Installation # Clone this repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/kuscadev/QuickLinks.git Customize the start page in your browser settings and set the link to the index.html file location.\nCustomization # There are two main sections that you can customize:\n🎨 Theme Customization: QuickLinks supports theme switching and visual customization using CSS variables and the data-theme attribute.\n🔄 Switching Themes\nYou can change the theme by adding the data-theme attribute to the \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; tag: Example:\n\u0026lt;html data-theme=\u0026#34;dracula\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Available themes:\ndefault dracula rose-pine-moon catppuccin 🎯 Customizing Colors and Fonts\nEach theme uses scoped CSS variables. You can override these variables to adjust colors, fonts, or spacing.\nExample:\n[data-theme=\u0026#34;dracula\u0026#34;] { --bg-color: #282a36; --text-color: #f8f8f2; --primary-color: #bd93f9; } [data-theme=\u0026#34;catppuccin\u0026#34;] { --bg-color: #1e1e2e; --text-color: #cdd6f4; --primary-color: #f5e0dc; } 🛠 Modifying the Default Theme\nIf you want to tweak the default theme, update the variables under [data-theme=\u0026quot;default\u0026quot;]:\n[data-theme=\u0026#34;default\u0026#34;] { --bg-color: #232136; --text-color: #e0def4; --primary-color: #f6c177; /* Customize as needed */ } 🌐 Global Variables (:root) Variables declared under :root are shared across all themes. These typically include:\nFont size Border radius Box shadow Example:\n:root { --font-size: 20px; --heading-size: 70px; --mobile-heading-size: 50px; --box-border-radius: 15px; --box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px #232136; } Use these variables to define global layout styles that remain consistent regardless of the selected theme.\n✅ Note: Theme-specific colors should be set under [data-theme=\u0026quot;...\u0026quot;], while cross-theme styling should be placed under :root.\nLinks: Although the default links are useful for daily use, you can add your own links and remove any unnecessary ones by modifying the index.html file.\nUpcoming Features # Dark/Light Theme Support: A toggle feature to switch between dark and light themes for a personalized visual experience. Link Management: An interface where users can dynamically add, edit, and organize their links. Date and Time Display: A section that shows the current time and date at the top of the page. Search Bar: A feature that allows users to quickly search for specific links within the page.
